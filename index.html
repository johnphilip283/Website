								<p>
                                    I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Computer Science and Mathematics major at Northeastern
                                    University. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me scrolling through Twitter,
									reading books about math / machine learning, or trying to find the best
									mozzarella sticks in Boston.

								<p>
									My friend and I created this website in order to create a platform for
									pet owners to find sitters that accommodate needs for more unconventional pets.
									This project was really useful for learning full-stack website development,
									by allowing me to understand how data flows from the front end all the way to the
									database.

								<p> Technologies Used: React.js, Express, Node.js, MySQL, WebStorm </p>

								<p>
									I created a neural network that was designed to reconstruct original images from
									their corrupted inputs. This project really taught me a lot about how neural
									networks actually work, how to build them, and how they internally represent the
                                    data they process.

								<p>
									This is a cross-platform mobile app that my friends and I wrote in order to allow
									students to view what items are on sale at Trash2Treasure, a garage-sale type event
									held at Northeastern every year. This project was really interesting in that I 
									learned a lot about the the design lifecycle, repeatedly iterating on the design of the
									app based on heuristic and user evaluations.

								I created a recommendation system for movies using the OMDB API, as well as the

								ETL pipelines, and understand the nuances of working with high-dimensional data.

								<h2>Work Experience // Extracurriculars</h2>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Wayfair</h3>
									<h5>Software Engineering Co-op</h5>
									<p>
										This January, I'll be starting a new position as a software engineering co-op at
										Wayfair. I'll be working on the Strategic Finance Engineering team, building
										full-stack applications to create, maintain and provide accurate financial
										information for Wayfair's monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports to the U.S
                                        Securities and Exchange Commission.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Association for Computing Machinery</h3>
									<h5>Executive Board Member</h5>
									<p>
										In my opinion, technological curiosity is one of the most important traits a
										CS student can have. That's why I've been working to bring engineers from top
										companies like Google and Spotify to Northeastern to talk about the unique
										large-scale problems that they face, and the creative solutions they employ to
										tackle them.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>FX Digital</h3>
									<h5>Research and Development Intern</h5>
									<p>
										Last summer, I had the privilege of going to London to work for FX Digital, a
										small startup that creates interactive experiences for their clientele. I
										worked on creating Alexa skills for clients, building audio visualization
										software and integrating a web application into an Android TV app for the
                                        Discovery Channel. Going abroad and being exposed to a different kind of work
                                        environment was a really life-changing experience, and it opened my eyes to the
                                        possibilities of working abroad in the future.

									<h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
									<h5>Object-Oriented Design & Programming with Data</h5>
									<p>
                                        Teaching is a huge passion of mine. Nothing beats the sense of happiness I feel
                                        when a student is struggling with a concept, and I'm able to explain it in terms
                                        they're able to understand. I've TA'd for Programming with Data, a course
                                        designed to introduce data science to non-majors, as well as
                                        Object-Oriented Design, an upper level CS elective aimed at teaching students
                                        design patterns, scalability, and best design practices of software development.

									<h3>Whoop</h3>
                                    <h5>Data Analytics Co-op</h5>
									<p>
                                        Last January, I co-oped at Whoop, where I performed preliminary research on
                                        potential changes to their calorie calculation algorithm. I also developed a
                                        notification system for users who were wearing their Whoop straps incorrectly,
                                        based on time-series accelerometer and heart rate data. I learned a surprising
                                        amount about the intersection of data analytics and human physiology after
                                        working at Whoop, and it was a very formative experience in my journey as a
                                        student.

									<h3>Project Programming</h3>
                                    <h5>Lead Program Coordinator</h5>
									<p>
                                        Project Programming was a project some friends and I undertook in high school to
                                        increase elementary school students' access to computer science education. We
                                        created lesson plans, did live workshops, and led interactive coding seminars to
                                        a class of about 20 students ranging from 3<sup>rd</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup>
                                        graders. We were really excited to see about a 50-50 male/female ratio, as well
                                        as a large turnout of traditionally underrepresented minority groups in computer
                                        science.
